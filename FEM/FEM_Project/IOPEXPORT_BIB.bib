	abstract = {Because of its wide deck, elegant design and reasonable stress, the steel truss arch bridge is suitable for urban bridges. In the steel truss arch bridge, the main arch hinge is an important structure, the local structure and the stress is complex, and it is necessary to analyze the local stress state of the arch hinge. Arch hinge problem belongs to the contact problem, this paper based on Chengdu Tianfu District Shenyang Lu Xi Duan Jin Jiang in bearing steel truss arch bridge design, take the finite element software ANSYS on the main arch hinge is locally analyzed, the arch at the junction of reliable performance test. Studies have shown that half through steel truss arch bridge should be adopted by reasonable cylindrical arch hinge, and Hertz theory is in the analysis of the arch hinge contact does not apply.}
