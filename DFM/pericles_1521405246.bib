abstract = {This paper presents possibilities of simulating composites materials in SolidWorks environment and selected aspects of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) design and manufacturing process (real airplane model was used in Air Cargo Challenge 2013 competition). First part of article contains informations about types of composite materials, mechanical properties and their structures. UAV wing design process is presented as multistage task. Next part of manuscript includes numerical analysis which deals with two cases of composites structures: laminates and sandwich composites. Differences in values of displacement and principal stresses (P1, P3) were shown in considered structures based on equal boundary conditions. Final part of article deals with development of manufacture process.},,
