abstract="The present work attempts to provide a review on tribological performance of natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites. Topics related to natural fibre, polymer, composites and tribology have been discussed. Composites have unique properties which can only be obtained by the combination of specific fibres and matrix materials. Today these composites are used in many areas such as automotive and construction which require good mechanical and tribological properties. However, shortcomings in the usage of these fibres, led by environmental concerns, have motivated researchers to explore the possibility of using natural fibres as an alternative.",
